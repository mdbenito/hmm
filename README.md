# hmm

This is a rather simple, possibly naive, implementation of a discrete
Hidden Markov Model with emissions given by a probability table.

## Disclaimer

There are libraries implementing this algorithm with many more features
and most likely optimization as well. You should probaby use those.

* [hmmlearn](https://github.com/hmmlearn): hmmlearn is a set of algorithms
  for unsupervised learning and inference of Hidden Markov Models.

For supervised learning use:

* [seqlearn](https://github.com/larsmans/seqlearn): seqlearn is a sequence
  classification toolkit for Python. It is designed to extend scikit-learn
  and offer as similar as possible an API.
